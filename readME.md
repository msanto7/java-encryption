## Description
	Our encryption program consists of 1 java file (partOne.java) which contains a main and three other functions used for encryption, decryption, and creating random hex values. Overall the program works just as specified. The user enters a 4 character string, then the key and intial vector are created pseudo randomly. It generates the ES, EK, and EIV using a for loop. We print out these values and then proceed to encrypt by calling our encryption function. Next we decrypt to get back to our original message and print these values.

## Testing the Program 
●	To test the program simply run the partOne.java file and have the user enter the 4 character string.
●	The results should be as expected.
